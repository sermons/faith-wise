Who is **wise** and **understanding** among you?

Let them show it by their good **life**, <br/>
by **deeds** done in the **humility** <br/>
that comes from wisdom.

<span class="ref">14</span>
But if you harbor bitter **envy** and <br/>
selfish **ambition** in your hearts, <br/>
do not **boast** about it or deny the **truth**.

<span class="ref">15</span>
Such “wisdom” does not come down from heaven <br/>
but is **earthly**, unspiritual, **demonic**.

<span class="ref">16</span>
For where you have envy and selfish ambition, <br/>
there you find **disorder** and every **evil** practice.

---
<span class="ref">17</span>
But the wisdom that comes from **heaven** <br/>
is first of all **pure**; then **peace**-loving, <br/>
**considerate**, **submissive**, <br/>
full of **mercy** and good **fruit**, <br/>
**impartial** and **sincere**.

<span class="ref">13</span>
**Peacemakers** who sow in peace  <br/>
reap a **harvest** of righteousness.
